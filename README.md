## Installing Git for Microsoft Windows

To install Git for Microsoft Windows, go to [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

For the Learning Git book, we recommend you use the first and main download option to install Git which provides an installer. To do so, select the **Click here to download** link. This will download an installer that you will use to go through the step-by step installation process. You should accept all the default settings as you go through the installer.

By using this download option to install Git, you will also have a version of Git installed which is definitely greater than 2.23 which is the minimum version we recommend in order to have access to all the commands in this book.

## Installing Git for macOS

To install Git for macOS, go to [https://git-scm.com/download/mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).

For the Learning Git book, we recommend you use Homebrew to install Git. To install Git using Homebrew, you must have Homebrew installed. If you donâ€™t have Homebrew installed then you must download it from the official Homebrew website [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/).

By using Homebrew to install Git, you will also have a version of Git installed which is definitely greater than 2.23 which is the minimum version we recommend in order to have access to all the commands in this book.

## Set up HTTPS authentication

## Create a personal access token in GitHub

In Chapter 6 of Learning Git, you are instructed to choose a hosting service and set up an authentication method. If you choose to use the HTTPS authentication method and you are using GitHub, you must create a personal access token.

The instructions for how to create a personal access token in GitHub are available at: [GitHub Docs - Creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

While going through the instructions above, keep in mind the below notes that were presented to you in Chapter 6.

When creating the personal access token in GitHub:

- The Note field represents the name for the personal access token
- When selecting an expiration time, we recommend choosing at minimum a time period within which you can finish reading and doing the exercises in the entire book. Otherwise, your personal access token may expire while you're going through the book and you will have to go through the process to create a new one to complete the exercise in the book.
- The scope defines what this token will have access to do or authenticate. For the purpose of this book, you must select at least the repo scope.
- Save the personal access token in a safe place.

## Create an app password in Bitbucket

In Chapter 6 of Learning Git, you are instructed to choose a hosting service and set up an authentication method. If you choose to use the HTTPS authentication method and you are using Bitbucket, you must create an app password.

The instructions for how to create an app password in Bitbucket are available at: [Bitbucket Support - Create an App password](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/create-an-app-password/).

While going through the instructions above, keep in mind the below notes that were presented to you in Chapter 6.

When creating an app password in Bitbucket:

- The Label field represents the name for the app password.
- The permissions describe what this app password will be able to authenticate. For the purposes of this book you should select at least the options under the sections, Account, Workspace membership, Projects, Repositories, and Pull Requests.
- Save the app password in a safe place.

## Set up SSH authentication

In Chapter 6 of Learning Git, you are instructed to choose a hosting service and set up an authnetication method, either HTTPS or SSH. If you choose to use the SSH authentication method, then you may use the links below that provide instructions for how to set up SSH authentication for each hosting service.
